# 📱 Mobile Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project uses a deep learning model (Keras) to perform scalar regression and predict the prices of mobile phones based on their specifications.

## 🚀 Goal
To build a regression model that can estimate phone prices using features like RAM, battery, camera, and display resolution.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- Jupyter Notebook
- MinMaxScaler for normalization
- EarlyStopping to avoid overfitting

## 📊 Model Performance
- Final test Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ₹6,078
- Data split: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test

## 📁 Files Included
- `MobilePrice.ipynb` - Full training and evaluation notebook
- `Project_Report.pdf` - Written answers to all questions
- `requirements.txt` - Required Python packages

## 📌 Key Concepts Learned
- Data cleaning and feature selection
- One-hot encoding for categorical data
- Normalization using MinMaxScaler
- Overfitting vs generalization
- EarlyStopping to retain the best model

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Try feature engineering (pixel density, camera score)
- Experiment with model architecture and tuning
- Analyze error patterns to improve accuracy
